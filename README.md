# 👋 Hi, I’m Ahmad Malek

I work at the intersection of **Marketing Automation, CRM, and Data Analytics**, combining hands-on campaign execution with data-driven insights.

With a business background, I focus on the **“why” behind the data** using analytics not just to report numbers, but to improve customer strategies, optimize campaigns, and support smarter decision-making. After working extensively with **Adobe Campaign** and **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**, I transitioned deeper into **CRM data analytics**, leveraging **SQL, Python, and data visualization** to analyze customer behavior, engagement, and campaign performance.

Today, my focus is on **bridging automation and analytics** turning marketing data into actions that scale.
